- 👋 Hi, I’m @ZorbakScape
- 👀 I’m interested in Java as it is the basis of many things i love such as runelite minecraft mods and some android apps 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning python and java as a start then branch out to more stuff 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that will help me learn as i am still a relative beginner
